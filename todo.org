# Urgent (do before "release")
- Font :: get width of characters in pixels
- Errors :: Do real error handling instead of just panicking everywhere
- Logging :: Send error output to log file
- Config :: Clean up the interpretation code. I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to make
            it a lot nicer. Look into functional ways to do this, like filter_map()

# Dependencies
dzen2 - bars
amixer - sound
xterm, xwininfo - char_width
xrandr - resolution

# Features to add
- Volume :: Use a sound library to be able to update in real time
- Battery :: Add charge / discharge time (different color for each, make the +/- of the battery bar optional)
             This will involve switching from using /sys/class directly to using acpi
- Network :: Add indicator, also bar for wifi signal strength
- Color parsing :: the config file should support single colors either as [r, g, b] or
                   as hex string.
- Bug testing :: Especially make sure files / command outputs used are universal
- System tray :: Figure out trayer vs. stalonetray, will have to be done differently
                 than other bars


# Eventual
- Backend :: Replace dzen2 with something built-in. I don't really want to write to XLib
             myself, but don't know what else would be nearly as lightweight.
- Cpu graph :: can't do until replacing backend
