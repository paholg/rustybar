# Urgent (do before "release")
- Font :: get width in pixels of characters
- Errors :: Do real error handling instead of just panicking everywhere
- Bars :: add network bar
- Logging :: Send error output to log file

# Semi important
- Volume :: Use a sound library to be able to update in real time
- Color parsing :: the config file should support single colors either as [r, g, b] or
                   as hex string.
- Bug testing :: Especially make sure files / command outputs used are universal

# Eventual
- Backend :: Replace dzen2 with something built-in. I don't really want to write to XLib
             myself, but don't know what else would be nearly as lightweight.
- Config :: Clean up the interpretation code. I'm sure it wouldn't be that hard to make
            it a lot nicer.
