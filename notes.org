# To Figure out:
- Font :: find dimensions given monospace font size (it's 1/72*dpi*fontsize). So I just
          need a good way to find dpi. Why do we use this retarded system?
- Globals :: Fix how global variables are done / if I can do without them (currently
             only for text and bg color). Not sure how to import them, so for now I'll
             define them in each bar file.
- Strings :: Bar text is stored as a String that keeps getting added to with format!()
             (sometimes with multiple format! calls per update). Is there a better way
             to do this?
