# To Figure out:
- Font :: find dimensions given monospace font size (it's 1/72*dpi*fontsize). So I just
          need a good way to find dpi. Why do we use this retarded system?
- Lifetimes :: do I want to keep 'static or switch to something else for StatusBar::Show
- Processes :: Does each bar get its own process, started in its initialize() function,
               or do I define processes in main() based on how/when each thing is
               updated (as I do in the python code).
