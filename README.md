Rustybar
=====
A simple, customizable statusbar written in Rust. It is designed to work with XMonad,
but should work with any similar window manager. Its purpose is to be lightweight but featureful.

It currently uses dzen2 as a backend, but may eventually be changed to do everything
internally for increased features.
