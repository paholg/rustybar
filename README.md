Rustybar
=====

A simple, customizable statusbar written in Rust. It is designed to work with XMonad,
but should work with any similar window manager. Its purpose is to be lightweight but
featureful.

It currently uses dzen2 as a backend, but may eventually be changed to do everything
internally for increased features.

Someday, this will include instructions. For now, your best bet is to look at and play
with the config file.



To build, simply run
```
Cargo build --release
```
